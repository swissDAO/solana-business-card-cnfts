## üéâ Congratulations

You have now made a cNFT minter that dynamically creates a cNFT from an in-browser image. That's pretty cool if you ask me!

Here is a recap on what we covered:
- [x] Generate a digital business card as a SVG in your browser
- [x] Convert that SVG to a PNG and upload it to Irys (formerly Bundlr)
- [x] Mint the PNG as a cNFT using Helius
- [x] Display all of the business card cNFTs in a gallery
- [x] Deploy our site Live to the world and allow people to mint business cards ==**without connecting their wallet**== 

If you need compare your final code, you can check the [complete solution](https://github.com/swissDAO/solana-business-card-cnfts/tree/final).

Now spice it up! Don't just stop with my business card model, create your own SVG with something like this [SVG Editor](https://boxy-svg.com/), or add it to something you've already built.

Maybe you have a Solana Pay store you want to hook it up to it for receipts or loyalty cNFTs, or a game where the user can get a cNFT of their score.

Don't just stop here, keep building! And if you do, share it with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_matt_xyz), I always love checking out new projects in the Solana space.

Also, if you think you're ready to take on a harder challenge, check out our other build where we combine [Solana Pay with cNFTs](https://github.com/swissDAO/solana-pay-cnfts). This will teach you how to build your own Merkle Tree for cNFTs and how to issue them upon verification of a Solana Pay transaction. It's a pretty sweet bundle and worth checking out!

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!!

**Until next time, friend** ‚úåÔ∏è.
