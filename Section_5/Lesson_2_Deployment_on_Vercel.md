## ðŸš¢ Deploy on Vercel

Everything is working, woo-hoo! Now it's time to get off localhost and ship our creation to the masses!

My go to for deployments is Vercel because it works so well with Next.JS. 

I like to connect to Vercel via my Github because it makes it super simple. After selecting "Add New" click "Project" and you should see something like this:

Then choose the repo you want to import and before you click "Deploy" open up the dropdown for "Environment Variables" and copy/paste your `.env` here.

After that, your deployment will start and upon completion you will see:

SICK!!! YOU ARE OFFICIALLY OFF LOCALHOST!!!!

If you head to the dashboard you will see Vercel has already created a domain for you.
